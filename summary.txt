The amount max that a shopper brings to the check out is extended from 5 to 100 items to give a better representation of different peoples needs going to the store

I changed the checker idle time down to 0.2 which would give more of a representation of an actual employee looking for customers

10 items per minute for the checker to check items is really slow, even for a new employee so, 
I bumped that number up to 30 which is 0.5 items per second so an item per 2 seconds which is more reasonable

changed the timing of when a customer shows up from 2 to 1 - 5 minutes to mimic more busy/slow times in the store

changed the number of checkers to 3 

avg wait time down to roughly 3 minutes
total idle time is down to 38 minutes
these seem normal for a regular store
